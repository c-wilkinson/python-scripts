# Python Scripts
A personal collection of Python scripts for solving annoyances, automating repetitive tasks, and experimenting with new ideas.  
Some are polished, some are quick hacks - all are here because they proved useful at least once.

## Contents

| Script                        | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| [`photo_frame_sync.py`](photo_frame_sync.py)        | Emails new photos from a local folder to a Pix-Star digital frame. Tracks sent files using SQLite. A workaround after Google Photos API changes broke direct sync. |
| [`google-translation.py`](google-translation.py)      | Command-line utility that uses Google Translate to translate phrases between languages. Great for quick lookups and rough translations. |
| [`semantic-model-translator.py`](semantic-model-translator.py) | Translates semantic model resources (created with eGain's semantic model editor). This was a development tool I knocked up to see if translations could be done using Google. This is highly bespoke and was a POC piece. |
| [`extract_kindle_books.py`](extract_kindle_books.py) | Extracts book titles and authors from Kindle’s local cache (KindleSyncMetadataCache.xml) and saves them to a CSV file. |
| [`scramble_pad.py`](scramble_pad.py) | Tkinter app to practise entering a fixed 4-digit PIN on a scramble-pad. Measures accuracy and speed. |
